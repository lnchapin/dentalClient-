# Dental Lab Quiz
[Live Site](http://dentallabquiz.surge.sh/)

This project was built to dig into how React, Radio Buttons, and Forms work together. I used to work in a dental lab and one issue that we had was the large volume of knowledge that is required for working in this field. Based on that experience I decided to focus this quiz around some of that information. In building this project I also built a database for the questions using PostgreSQL. The repo for that database can be found [here](https://github.com/lnchapin/dentalServer-).
